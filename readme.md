## Removed the need for docker. It's ready to upload to your web server.

Changes:
1. Removed Docker files
2. Added 'index.html' to the root directory that redirects you to the login page
3. Removed the need to manually enter your domain name in a file by setting relative paths:<br>
  File: '/application/dist/js/custom.js' <br>
¬ª var api_base_url="/api/public/";<br>
¬ª var api_site_url="/api/public/index.php"; <br>
  <i>(if you install in a sub folder, put the name of the folder before /api & add it to the 'index.html' file in the root directory)</i>
<br>
<br>

## Minimum Server Requirement
